# TurboSPI
This is another Arduino SPI library separated from SdFat library, it uses SPI registers and DMA (Arduino Due only) to accelerate SPI communication.

I have test this library on Arduino Uno/Mega2560/Due, maybe support other AVR/SAM3X MCUs.
You can search keywords like "Arduino Mega2560 pinout" to find pinout mapping with your board like this:
